GUI FLOW:

On startup, settings are checked
If they exist and can be loaded from settings.json, they are.
Otherwise, the default settings are loaded and saved to the settings file

Then, users are checked.
If none exist, CreateUser GUI pops up

From the ManageUsers GUI:
  Clicking on Back simply goes to the user info GUI
  Clicking on Cancel closes the GUI with no effect
  Clicking switch to this user switches the user and then checks for a database.
      if the filename exists, it loads it up (after verifying titles exist)
      and goes to the main GUI
      if there is no database, it opens the Manage Database GUI
  Clicking on Edit this User opens the EditUser GUI
  Clicking on Create New User opens the CreateUser GUI
  Clicking on Delete this user warns the user, and then removes that user from Settings
  Clicking on Switch to this

From the EditUser GUI:
  All this GUI can does is allow the opportunity to edit the user the name/email/site info for the user that was in the combobox
  Clicking Apply makes the changes and returns to the ManageUsers GUI
  Clicking Cancel returns to the ManageUsers GUI with no changes

From the CreateUser GUI:
    If data is verified, then user is added to settings and set as current user,
    and the ManageDatabase GUI is opened

From ManageDatabase GUI:
    Options to Replace/Add New DB from csv/sqlite will be available
        will warn if db exists
        pops up file dialog for opening file and then for saving db
        creates new db object with filename input parameter
        saves db filename to user settings
    Options to Update DB from csv/sqlite will only be available if db exists
        simply calls a method in DB object
        opens file dialog
        csv method opens csv, adds or ignores all fields with matching headers
        sqlite method connects to db and adds or ignores all fields with matching headers
        titles must exist for either
    Option to export to csv will only be available if db exists
        calls a method in DB object
        opens file dialog for save file
        pulls entire sqlite db and writes to csv
    Back returns to MainGUI but not allowed unless db exists

From UserInfo GUI:

    Manage Users simply opens the ManageUsers GUI
    Link takes user to their goodreads page if it exists

From the Main GUI:
    Clicking on User opens the UserInfo GUI
    Clicking on Manage Database simply opens the ManageDatabase GUI
    Clicking on Settings opens the Settings GUI
    Clicking on Quit terminates the program

    Clicking on Add Book adds a frame to the top with Entry boxes for each shown field
        Clicking add verifies the data and adds it to the db (and commits it)
    Clicking on Search causes the search entry to appear and then accesses the db search functions


    All settings in the settings GUI update instantly, so the only option is Back to the main GUI
    (settings are saved by the user)
