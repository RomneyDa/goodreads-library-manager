It's funny and easy to understand, and offers hundreds of very specific actions and recipes that can contribute to making every day a great day. The way it presents some of the science seems faulty - sort of brosciency, but the citations are actually pretty solid. I especially like the format and attitude of each chapter - getting owned to owning it and then specific actions to ""own it.""<br/><br/>Good stuff!",,,1,,,0,,,,,
